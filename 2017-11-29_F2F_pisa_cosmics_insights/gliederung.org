* Overview
- 
* Update on GCR Data and MC
* Track Parameter Distribution in August GCR Data and MC (prod. 1)
* Reminder: Estimation of Finding Efficiency
* Challenges
* Sketch / Event Display of Finding Fail Event
* Approach / Steps
* Two-track dataset based on MC Truth: Split MC Tracks on MC hit distance
General Idea, 
* Distribution of Hit $\Delta t$ for all hits in all tracks} 
* Trackfinding-independent selection of expected two-track-events
* Distribution of selection parameters for two- and one-track-events
* Event displays in different regions
* Cut unphysical events based on track parameters?
Cut 
* Interesting: QCS-R seen in PT difference
* Efficiency Plots
* Discussion
* Outlook

* Backup
** Kinematic Distributions for Juli GCR
** MCTrack Splitting Code
** Code for Splitting Tracks in MC Track Finder
