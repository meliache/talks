* Overview
- 
* New GCR Data and MC
* Track Parameter Distribution in August GCR Data and MC (prod. 1)
* Reminder: Estimation of Finding Efficiency
* Necessary Steps
* Generate Track Dataset MC based on MC Truth: Split MC Tracks on Hit Distance $c \cdot \Delta t$
* Select Events where we expect to find two Tracks
* Efficiency Plots
* Kinematic Distributions for Juli GCR
* Distribution of Hit $\Delta t$ for all hits in all tracks} 
* Example Finding Fail Event
* Code for Splitting Tracks in MC Track Finder
