** Retraining and revalidating Master thesis results via =b2luigi=
- I needed to retrain the old weightfiles for the CDC QI
- my old scripts for training and validation needed to be updated (they were a mess)
- with my experience from the semitaonic hackathon, I decided to refactor and port them to =b2luigi=
- it was easy to do, the reproducibility helps me to trust my own results and showed that my past results still hold
- will definetly use that more, e.g. for testing the full quality indicator and of course in analysis

** Redid thesis efficiency plots with efficiencies via =uncertain_panda=
 *Warning*: here the finding efficiency is with CDC-only tracking, but normalized to primary MC
  tracks which have hit anywhere in the detector (e.g. VXD only). The jobs with the correct MC
  matching for the CDC are still running.

** Get going with the merge requests
- started with CDC QI ([[https://stash.desy.de/projects/B2/repos/software/pull-requests/3633][Link]])
[[./figures/merge_request.png]]
(I shouldn't be so nervous about that)

** Other news
- enjoyed some of the talks from the KSETA workshop
- flavor-physics was presented from theory-side by Marta and Danny van Dyk
- how do I delete a talk from the ekp talk page?
