* Introduction
** Personal issues with my PhD recently
** Idea: Work with the garage door open
- don't just show finished results, "thinking aloud"
- discuss problems, which encourages others to do so
- downside: not every single personal issue and bugfix is interesting for everyone
- reference: [[https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu][Andy Matuschak: Work with the garage door up]]
* This week so far
** Monday
- implemented [[file:~/org/roam/20201029235900-b2luigi.org][b2luigi]] [[https://github.com/nils-braun/b2luigi/pull/51][PR #51]] which replaces some string parsing of gbasf2 commands
  outputs via Dirac API
  - motivated by new releases, reduced risk of output-changing releases braking things
  - quite glad that b2luigi is being used more (e.g. systematics calibration framework)
  - but maintaining should take a fixed short time slot and in the end it's open
    source, so I hope people will help if they find something
** Tuesday
- testet my PR from previous day
- Got assigned Jira Issue [[https://agira.desy.de/browse/BII-7443][BII-7443]] about [[file:~/org/roam/20201029235900-basf2.org][basf2]] compilations by [[file:~/org/roam/20201028235900-markus_prim.org][Markus]] and
  spent some time studying it
- had a spike in [[file:~/org/roam/20201029235900-impostor_syndrome.org][impostor syndrome]] and "existential crisis", but talking with [[file:~/org/roam/20201028105609-ilias_tsaklidis.org][Ilias]] and others helped
** Wednesday
- many meetings (BBAM, Physics V, [[file:~/org/roam/20201028151738-neue_pi_webseite.org][insitute website discussion]] which I should
  have skipped)
- started cross-checking physics 5 exercise and next week's prepare tutorial
- discovered and procrastinated with [[https://www.orgroam.com][org-roam]], an emacs clone of [[https://roamresearch.com/
][roam research]],
  - a note-taking tool for networked thought with bi-directional links
  - might be useful to keep notes on papers
** Thursday
- started time-tracking for myself again
- planned to using the morning to finish physics 5 exercise, but actually
  ended up taking whole day
  - included reading up on the lecture and literature and trying to understand
    things for myself
* Review
** What was good
- burn-out averted: I feel responsible for myself and my work again (opposite of
  feeling of helplessnes)
- started working on routines habits again
- feel more connected to the group
** Not so good
- still not doing what I was going to do
* Plans
** Think of strategy
